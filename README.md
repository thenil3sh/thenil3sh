Hi, you've visited thenil3sh's profile page

## About Me
- I'm lazy
- Right now, I'm rooting into Android Dev with Kotlin (garbage collection, aww yes!!). Soon, on this profile, you'll notice some projects around it (and maybe don't).
- I love, solving my own problems, lol. Soon as I face it, appears a new project.
- Working on webassembly is also something I enjoy (just to avoid writing another line of javascript).
